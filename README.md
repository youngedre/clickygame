# Clicky-Game

## Overveiw
This is a memory game built using react, featuring anime heros. The goal of this is to click each hero once and only once, testing your memory skills.
## Demo
You will begin by clicking whichever character you chose to start with, causing the cards to reshuffle. From there you will select a new one and the process continues your score will go up, seen in the right hand corner. If you make it all the way through a winning message will be displayed at the top of the screen. 
Good luck!
